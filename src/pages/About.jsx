              Hello! Iâ€™m Nayanshree Soni, a B.Tech graduate in Information
              Technology with a strong interest in building functional and
              user-friendly digital solutions. I have developed a solid
              foundation in HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript, and I also have
              hands-on experience working with React. To further strengthen my
              skills, I completed a professional training program in MERN Stack
              development at Makerspace Technology (BECIL). This experience
              enhanced my ability to work on full-stack applications and
              deepened my understanding of modern web development tools and
              practices. I'm passionate about writing clean, efficient code and
              enjoy turning ideas into real-world projects. I thrive on
              challenges and am always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to
              meaningful work.
